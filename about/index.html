<article class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Our interests range from Open Source to Information Security. I am also interested in web development, Cryptocurrencies, and zeitgeist movement.
    
  We are also a member of the Pirate Party, COSS and EFFI.

	Also, we have a great taste of humor, although not everyone gets it, because it's a bit dark and nerdy. Occupational hazards, we guess.

	We are constantly looking for new IT-projects to help people out and to improve ourself and to sharpen our skill set. </p>
